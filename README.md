# Visual Approach for X-Plane

**WORKS WITH Zibo 737 only**

This LUA script allows to take a brief look at the threshold of the runway that you arriving to.
This is espessialy useful during performing visual approaches.

## Installation

Place `visual_approach.lua` file into `<X-Plane>\Resources\plugins\FlyWithLua\Scripts` folder

## Usage

After the script is installed you can assign keyboard or joystick key to look at a runway. Action name `FlyWithLua/VisualApproach/LookAtRnw`

The sript takes information about arriving runway from FMS. So in order to make it work FMS should have arriving runway set **and route activated**, what usually is the case for most of the flights, meaning no additional configuration is needed.
